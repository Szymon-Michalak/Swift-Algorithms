# Run-length encoding

## Problem

Write a function that accepts a string as input, then returns how often each letter is repeated in a single run, taking case into account.
Tip: This approach is used in a simple lossless compression technique called run-length encoding.

#### Input

Function accepts string as input.

#### Output

Function returns integer.

#### Constraints

N/A

#### Example

> **Input:**  
> "aabbcc"  
> **Output:**  
> "a2b2c2"

> **Input:**  
> "aaabaaabaaa"  
> **Output:**  
> "a3b1a3b1a3"

> **Input:**  
> "aaAAaa"  
> **Output:**  
> "a2A2a2"
